## üìù List of Problems

### **Basic Exceptions** ‚ö†Ô∏è
This section contains Java programs demonstrating various common exceptions, along with a brief explanation for each. These exceptions are critical to understanding error handling in Java.

1. Write a program to demonstrate `NullPointerException` in Java with an example?

2. Write a program to demonstrate `ArithmeticException` in Java with an example of division by zero?

3. Write a program to demonstrate `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in Java? Write an example.

4. Write a program to demonstrate `ClassNotFoundException` in Java? Can you give an example?

5. Write a program to demonstrate `FileNotFoundException` in Java? Can you demonstrate its usage with throw and throws?

6. Write a program to demonstrate `NumberFormatException` in Java? Use try-catch-finally to handle it.

7. Write a program to demonstrate `IllegalArgumentException` in Java?

8. Write a program to demonstrate `IOException` in Java? Can you show an example with throws?

9. Write a program to demonstrate `ConcurrentModificationException` in Java? Write an example.

10. Write a program to demonstrate `TimeoutException` in Java? How can it be handled?

11. Write a program to demonstrate `SQLException` in Java? How can it be handled?

## **Handling Exceptions** üõ†Ô∏è

1. How do you handle exceptions using `try-catch` in Java?

2. How can you use the `finally` block in exception handling? Provide an example.

3. How does the `throws` keyword work? Demonstrate with a program.

4. Write a program to throw a custom exception using the `throw` keyword.

5. How can you create and use a `custom exception class` in Java?

---

## **Advanced Concepts** üîç

1. How do you `rethrow an exception` in Java?

2. What is `exception chaining`, and how is it implemented?

3. What are `suppressed exceptions`, and how are they managed in `try-with-resources`?

4. How do you create a `custom exception with additional fields` for more information?

5. How can you handle `exceptions in lambda expressions`?
